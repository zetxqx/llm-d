# Proxy

The proxy is the entry point for inference requests in llm-d Router, receiving client traffic and routing it to the optimal model server via the EPP. Supported implementations range from self-managed application load balancers (e.g., Istio, agentgateway, Envoy AI Gateway) to compliant cloud-managed services, such as Google Cloud's Application Load Balancer. It supports two primary deployment modes: **Standalone Mode**, where a self-managed proxy runs alongside the EPP in the same pod, and **Gateway Mode**, which integrates with L7 load balancers via the Kubernetes Gateway API.

## Functionality

llm-d leverages [External Processing](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_proc_filter) to extend production-grade proxies with the "LLM inference-aware" request routing implemented in the llm-d EPP. In this way, llm-d re-uses the rich existing ecosystem of high-performance, production-quality proxy technologies in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

The proxy's job is to:

- **Accept incoming inference requests** from clients (OpenAI-compatible API)
- **Consult the EPP** via ext-proc to determine the optimal backend endpoint
- **Route the request** to the selected model server pod
- **Stream responses** back to the client

### Request Flow (Both Modes)

Regardless of the deployment mode, the request flow is the same:

1. Client sends an inference request to the proxy
2. The proxy's ext-proc filter calls the EPP
3. The EPP evaluates endpoints using its plugin pipeline (handlers, filters, scorers, picker)
4. The EPP returns the selected endpoint address
5. The proxy forwards the request to that model server pod
6. The model server sends the response back to the proxy (which streams the result through the EPP for post-processing)

## Standalone Mode

The standalone mode deploys a proxy as a sidecar to the EPP, offering a lightweight, flexible deployment mode without requiring Gateway API infrastructure.

### When to Use

Standalone deployments are intended for workloads where the machinery of Gateway API creates too much operational overhead. This includes:

- Clusters using legacy Ingress controllers.
- Basic testing and local evaluations.
- Batch inference workloads.
- RL post-training pipelines.

### Architecture

In standalone mode, the conformant proxy runs alongside the EPP in the same pod.

- **Communication**: `ext-proc` communication happens over `localhost`.
- **Simplification**: No `Gateway`, `HTTPRoute`, or gateway controller is needed.
- **Access**: Traffic is sent directly to the EPP pod's externally exposed port.

## Gateway Mode (Inference Gateway)

Gateway Mode, also known as the **Inference Gateway**, leverages the official Kubernetes Gateway API project focused on L4 and L7 networking, representing the next generation of Kubernetes Load Balancing and Service Mesh APIs.

### When to Use

Gateway Mode is targeted at production environments that require:

- **Shared Infrastructure**: A single, shared Gateway can host multiple HTTP/gRPC routes for both inference workloads (represented as `InferencePool`) and traditional applications (standard Kubernetes `Service` objects).
- Integration with cloud-native L7 networking solutions (Istio, GKE Gateway, agentgateway, Envoy AI Gateway).
- Multi-cluster load balancing.
- Advanced traffic management (weighted splitting, mirroring).
- Exposure of endpoints to external workloads with robust control.

### Architecture

The [Gateway API Inference Extension (GAIE)](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/) extends Gateway API by leveraging [External Processing](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_proc_filter) to inject LLM-aware load balancing into the production-grade networking provided by the Gateway provider.

</p>

To connect an **InferencePool** (and the EPP it selects) to a **Gateway**, you use an **HTTPRoute** that references the pool as its backend. One of the powerful features of Gateway Mode is the ability to host complex routing topologies: a single `Gateway` can host multiple `HTTPRoute` objects, and each route can be configured with multiple **InferencePool** backends (e.g., for canary rollouts or traffic splitting) or a standard Kubernetes **Service**.

The following diagram illustrates the hierarchical routing structure in Gateway Mode, showing how requests are matched and distributed across multiple InferencePools and traditional Services:

 +-------------+   +-------------+                 +---------------+
```

Traffic is first matched against an `HTTPRoute` rule (typically using **path** or **header** matches). If the selected backend in that rule is an `InferencePool`, the request is parked while the EPP configured for that `InferencePool` is consulted for an inference-optimized routing decision.
