# P/D Disaggregation

LLM inference has two computationally distinct phases:

* **Prefill** processes the entire input prompt in a single forward pass - it is compute-bound, bottlenecked by the GPU flops available.
* **Decode** generates output tokens one at a time from the KV-cache - it is memory-bandwidth-bound, bottlenecked by how fast data moves from HBM to on-chip memory.

For long context workloads (10:1 ISL:OSL) and medium-to-large models, separating prefill and decode into separate instances enables:

* Improved throughput via specialization or prefill and decode
* Improved quality of service, as long context prefills will not block decode work

llm-d's EPP natively supports the concept of disaggregation, enabling composition with other scorers (e.g. prefix-aware routing).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NIXL supports TCP transfer, but high-bandwidth networking
> (IB, RoCE, EFA) is **highly recommended** for production usage.

## Deploy

See the [P/D Disaggregation guide](../../guides/pd-disaggregation) for manifests and step-by-step deployment.

The setup creates 2 `Deployments` of vLLM (all are part of the same `InferencePool`):
* The **prefill** `Deployment` is 4 replicas of TP=1 vLLM - labeled with `llm-d.ai/role=prefill`.
* The **decode** `Deployment` is 1 replica of TP=5 vLLM - labeled with `llm-d.ai/role=decode`. All these pods have a routing proxy sidecar.

During the standard request flow:
* Request arrives at the proxy, which forwards the request to the EPP
* EPP schedules the request with P/D disaggregation, using the labels to detect the decode and prefill variants
* Request is routed to the sidecar, which forwards the request to the prefill instance
* Prefill instance processes the prompt, returning metadata about how to retrieve the KV blocks
* Decode instance pulls the KVs over RDMA (IB, RoCE, EFA) with NIXL
* Decode instances processes the decodes
