# Batch Gateway

Process large-scale batch inference jobs via an OpenAI-compatible API, enabling batch and interactive workloads to coexist efficiently on shared infrastructure.

## When to Pick This Path

- You have **offline inference workloads** (such as evaluations, embeddings, dataset processing) that don't need real-time responses.
- You want to **utilize idle accelerator capacity** for batch work while protecting interactive traffic from interference.
- Your clients expect an **OpenAI-compatible Batch API** (`/v1/batches`, `/v1/files`) for job submission, tracking and management.
- You need **multi-tenant isolation** — each tenant's jobs, files, and results are separated.

## Prerequisites

- A working llm-d Router, inference pool, and at least one model server. If you don't have this, start with [getting-started/quickstart.md](../../../getting-started/quickstart.md).
- PostgreSQL (12+) and Redis (6+) or Valkey (8+) accessible from the cluster.
- S3-compatible storage or a shared PVC with `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode for batch input/output files.
- Helm 3.0+.
