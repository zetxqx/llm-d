llm-d is a high-performance distributed inference serving stack optimized for production deployments on Kubernetes. We help you achieve the fastest "time to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance" for key OSS large language models across most hardware accelerators and infrastructure providers with well-tested guides and real-world benchmarks.

llm-d is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) sandbox project, founded by Red Hat, Google Cloud, IBM Research, CoreWeave, and NVIDIA.

## What does llm-d offer to production inference?

Model servers like [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) handle efficiently running large language models on accelerators. llm-d provides state-of-the-art orchestration and optimizations above model servers to serve high-scale real-world traffic efficiently and reliably. Our offerings are organized into four core themes:

* **[Intelligent Routing:](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides#intelligent-routing)** Maximize performance with prefix-cache and load-aware balancing, including experimental predicted latency-based scheduling to decrease latency and increase throughput.
* **[Advanced KV-Cache Management:](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides#advanced-kv-cache-management)** Increase the effective "working set size" for multi-turn requests with tiered offloading to CPU or disk and precise global indexing of the KV cache state.
* **[Serving Large Models:](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides#serving-large-models)** Optimize massive models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS) using prefill/decode disaggregation and wide expert-parallelism over fast accelerator interconnects.
* **[Operational Excellence:](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides#operational-excellence)** Ensure production stability with intelligent flow control for multi-tenant serving and proactive, SLO-aware autoscaling based on real-time inference signals.
* **[Batch Processing:](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides#experimental)** Efficiently manage large-scale offline inference with OpenAI-compatible Batch APIs and asynchronous processing to maximize hardware utilization.

For a complete list of tested recipes and architectural patterns, see our [well-lit path guides](https://llm-d.ai/docs/guides). These guides provide benchmarked recipes and Helm charts to start serving quickly with best practices common to production deployments. Our intent is to eliminate the heavy lifting common in tuning and deploying generative AI inference on modern accelerators.

## Performance Highlights

Validated performance gains from production deployments and partner benchmarks:

* **3x higher output throughput** and **2x faster TTFT** with prefix-cache-aware routing vs round-robin — Llama 3.1 70B on 4× AMD MI300X, Tesla / Red Hat ([blog](https://llm-d.ai/blog/production-grade-llm-inference-at-scale-kserve-llm-d-vllm))
* **40% reduction in TTFT and ITL** with predicted-latency scheduling vs heuristics on NVIDIA GPUs, Google ([blog](https://llm-d.ai/blog/predicted-latency-based-scheduling-for-llms))
* **Up to 70% higher tokens/sec** with prefill/decode disaggregation vs standard vLLM — GPT-OSS on NVIDIA B200 (p6-b200), AWS ([blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-disaggregated-inference-on-aws-powered-by-llm-d/))
* **10–30% throughput improvement** with disaggregated serving on identical infrastructure — GPT-OSS-120B and Llama 3.3 70B on AMD MI300X, Oracle ([blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/llm-inference-at-scale-with-llm-d-on-oci))
* **50k tokens/sec** cluster throughput with Wide Expert-Parallelism — 16×16 NVIDIA B200, ~3.1k tok/s per GPU ([blog](https://llm-d.ai/blog/llm-d-v0.5-sustaining-performance-at-scale))
* **13.9x throughput improvement** with hierarchical KV offloading at 250 concurrent users vs GPU-only — 4× NVIDIA H100 ([blog](https://llm-d.ai/blog/llm-d-v0.5-sustaining-performance-at-scale))
